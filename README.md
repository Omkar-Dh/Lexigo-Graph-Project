# Lexigo Graph Solver

## Overview

Lexigo Graph Solver is an object-oriented Java application designed to fully solve USA Today's Lexigo graphical word puzzle. This project leverages efficient algorithms to achieve an overall time complexity of O(n). It includes customizable input parsing and implements a depth-first search algorithm using hashing and maps to validate sequenced word choices across connected clues.

## Features

- **Customizable Input Parsing**: Allows users to customize the input format for the Lexigo puzzles.
- **Efficient Algorithms**: Achieves an overall time complexity of O(n) to solve the puzzles.
- **Depth-First Search Algorithm**: Uses hashing and maps to efficiently validate word sequences.
- **Regular Expressions**: Ensures all word choices are valid according to the puzzle's rules.
